# guitar-fretboard-visualizer
This is an old VanillaJS project I created around March 2022 while taking a JavaScript class. This class was my first introduction to JS.
I wanted a faster way to access different guitar scales, modes, and chords without having to look them up every time. So I made this.
This project catapulted me into an interest in Web Development and JavaScript.
It has been abandoned because a similar feature will be implemented into MusiqTools.
